# List Generator for Active Directory Usernames

Hello there!

I wrote a small Python Script that creates a wordlist from potential Users using a common Active Directry naming convention.

Input first and last name. For example John Smith

Output will look like the following:
johnsmith
john.smith
john-smith
jsmith
j.smith
j-smith
johsmi
joh.smi
joh-smi

Hope it helps for your ethical hacking adventures:)
